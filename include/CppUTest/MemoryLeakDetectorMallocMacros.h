 * This file can be used to get extra debugging information about memory leaks in your production code.
 * It defines a preprocessor macro for malloc. This will pass additional information to the
 * malloc and this will give the line/file information of the memory leaks in your code.
 *
 * You can use this by including this file to all your production code. When using gcc, you can use
 * the -include file to do this for you.

/* Warning for maintainers:
 * This macro code is duplicate from TestHarness.h. The reason for this is to make the two files
 * completely independent from each other. NewMacros file can be included in production code whereas
 * TestHarness.h is only included in test code.

/* NOTE on strdup!
 *
 * strdup was implemented earlier, however it is *not* an Standard C function but a POSIX function.
 * Because of that, it can lead to portability issues by providing more than is available on the local platform.
 * For that reason, strdup is *not* implemented as a macro. If you still want to use it, an easy implementation would be:
 *
 * size_t length = 1 + strlen(str);
 * char* result = (char*) cpputest_malloc_location(length, file, line);
 * memcpy(result, str, length);
 * return result;
