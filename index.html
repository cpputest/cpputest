        <h2>What is CppUTest.</h2>

CppUTest is a C /C++ based unit xUnit test framework for unit testing and for test-driving your code. It is written in C++ but is used in C and C++ projects and frequently used in embedded systems but it works for any C/C++ project.

CppUTest is based on the following design principles
<ul>
<li>Simple in design and simple in use.
<li>Portable to old and new platforms.
</ul>

<h2>Where to get CppUTest</h2>

<p>The download link for github is at the top of this page. You can either get the latest code or a specific release.
</p><p>
You can find all the downloads <a href="https://github.com/cpputest/cpputest/downloads">at the download page</a>
</p><p>
Alternatively, you can clone the github repository, read-only:
<pre><code>git clone git://github.com/cpputest/cpputest.git
</code></pre>
Or clone it via ssh (which requires a github account)
<pre><code>git clone git@github.com:cpputest/cpputest.git
</code></pre>
</p>

<h2>Where to find more information</h2>

<ul>
<li> The CppUTest manual can be found at <a href="http://www.cpputest.org/">CppUTest.org</a>
<li> If you have any question, check out the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/cpputest">Google Groups</a>
<li> The source is at the <a href="https://github.com/cpputest/cpputest">main github page</a>
<li> You can report bugs or features at <a href="https://github.com/cpputest/cpputest/issues">the issues page</a>
<li> You can follow <a href="https://twitter.com/CppUTest">CppUTest on twitter</a>
</ul>
<h2>Quick introduction (some code!)</h2>
To write your first test, all you need is a new cpp file with a TEST_GROUP and a TEST, like:

<pre><code>TEST_GROUP(FirstTestGroup)
{
};

TEST(FirstTestGroup, FirstTest)
{
   FAIL("Fail me!");
}
</code></pre>

<p>This test will fail.</p>

<p>You can add new tests to the test group by just writing more tests in the file, like this:</p>

<pre><code>TEST(FirstTestGroup, SecondTest)
{
   STRCMP_EQUAL("hello", "world");
   LONGS_EQUAL(1, 2);
   CHECK(false);
}
</code></pre>

You do need to create a main where you run all the unit tests. Such a main will look like this:
<pre><code>int main(int ac, char** av)
{
   return CommandLineTestRunner::RunAllTests(ac, av);
}
</code></pre>
<p>For more information, I'd recommend to <a href="www.cpputest.org">read the manual</a> or, even better, check some <a href="https://github.com/cpputest/cpputest/tree/master/tests">existing tests</a> such as <a href="https://github.com/cpputest/cpputest/blob/master/tests/SimpleStringTest.cpp">SimpleStringTest</a> or (a bit more complicated) <a href="https://github.com/cpputest/cpputest/blob/master/tests/MemoryLeakDetectorTest.cpp">MemoryLeakDetectorTest</a> or the <a href="https://github.com/cpputest/cpputest/blob/master/tests/CppUTestExt/TestMockSupport.cpp">mocking tests</a> or just check out the <a href="https://github.com/cpputest/cpputest/blob/master/tests/CheatSheetTest.cpp">Cheat Sheet</a></p>
<h2>Authors and Contributors</h2>

<p>CppUTest has had many contributions from its users. We can't remember all, but we appreciate it a lot!. Much of the original code was written by Michael Feathers (based on CppUnit Lite). The current main maintainers are <a href="https://github.com/jwgrenning">@jwgrenning</a> and <a href="https://github.com/basvodde">@basvodde</a></p>
