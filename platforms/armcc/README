Makefile to build CppUTest library to run in hardware using ARM C/C++ compiler.

Also it is possible to build CppUTestExt library using
"make all COMPONENT_NAME=CppUTestExt".

All libraries is placed in lib directory of CppUTest home.

Thumb mode is using. For ARM mode, you need to remove compiler key
"--apcs=/interwork" and change $(CPU_MODE) to arm.

You need installed CYGWIN with make.exe, rm.exe, mkdir.exe and installed
  Keil MDK-ARM.

For compiling CppUTest library using ARMCC, please adjust Makefile:
1. # Path to cygwin binary
	CYGWIN_DIR :=C:/CYGWIN/bin
2. # Path to ARMCC of Keil MDK-ARM, with libraries, includes and executables
	KEIL_DIR   :=D:/Keil/ARM/ARMCC
3. # source CppUTest files
	CPPUTEST_HOME := ../..
4. other options explained in $(CPPUTEST_HOME)/build/MakefileWorker.mk
	CPPUTEST_USE_MEM_LEAK_DETECTION := Y
	CPPUTEST_USE_STD_CPP_LIB := N
	CPPUTEST_USE_VPATH := Y
	CPPUTEST_USE_STD_C_LIB := Y
	CPPUTEST_ENABLE_DEBUG := Y

You may add additional options "CPU=xx" and "CPU_MODE=yy"
CPU is an option that passed to armcc.exe. It selects CPU. List of CPU is
  available by executing 'armcc.exe --cpu list'.
  Default CPU architecture is ARM7TDMI.
  For armcc v5.02 build 28, CPU is one of the next:
    ARM7EJ-S
    ARM7TM
    ARM7TDM
    ARM7TDMI
    ARM710T
    ARM720T
    ARM740T
    ARM7TM-S
    ARM7TDMI-S
    ARM9TDMI
    ARM920T
    ARM922T
    ARM940T
    ARM9E-S
    ARM9EJ-S
    ARM926EJ-S
    ARM946E-S
    ARM966E-S
    ARM968E-S
    Cortex-M0
    Cortex-M0plus
    SC000
    Cortex-M1
    Cortex-M1.os_extension
    Cortex-M1.no_os_extension
    Cortex-M3
    Cortex-M3-rev0
    SC300
    Cortex-M4
    Cortex-M4.fp
    Cortex-R4
    Cortex-R4F

CPU_MODE is one of 'arm', 'thumb'.
  Default is thumb.

Tested with Keil MDK-ARM Pro v4.60
